# Julia Function with Missing Return Statement

This repository demonstrates a common error in Julia: a function missing a return statement for a specific case. The function `my_function` calculates the square of a number, but it doesn't explicitly handle the case where the input is 0, resulting in an error. The solution demonstrates how to handle this missing case by adding a return statement for x==0.  The code examples are in Julia language.
